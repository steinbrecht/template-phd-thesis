abstract = {Eukaryotic {mRNAs} are transcribed, processed, translated, and degraded in different subcellular compartments. Here, we measured {mRNA} flow rates between subcellular compartments in mouse embryonic stem cells. By combining metabolic {RNA} labeling, biochemical fractionation, {mRNA} sequencing, and mathematical modeling, we determined the half-lives of nuclear pre-, nuclear mature, cytosolic, and membrane-associated {mRNAs} from over 9000 genes. In addition, we estimated transcript elongation rates. Many matured {mRNAs} have long nuclear half-lives, indicating nuclear retention as the rate-limiting step in the flow of {mRNAs}. In contrast, {mRNA} transcripts coding for transcription factors show fast kinetic rates, and in particular short nuclear half-lives. Differentially localized {mRNAs} have distinct rate constant combinations, implying modular regulation. Membrane stability is high for membrane-localized {mRNA} and cytosolic stability is high for cytosol-localized {mRNA}. {mRNAs} encoding target signals for membranes have low cytosolic and high membrane half-lives with minor differences between signals. Transcripts of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins have long nuclear retention and cytoplasmic kinetics that do not reflect co-translational targeting. Our data and analyses provide a useful resource to study spatiotemporal gene expression regulation. \copyright 2024. The Author(s).}

abstract = {Mitochondria are complex organelles that house essential pathways involved in energy metabolism, ion homeostasis, signalling and apoptosis. To understand mitochondrial pathways in health and disease, it is crucial to have an accurate inventory of the organelle's protein components. In 2008, we made substantial progress toward this goal by performing in-depth mass spectrometry of mitochondria from 14 organs, epitope tagging/microscopy and Bayesian integration to assemble {MitoCarta} (www.broadinstitute.org/pubs/{MitoCarta}): an inventory of genes encoding mitochondrial-localized proteins and their expression across 14 mouse tissues. Using the same strategy we have now reconstructed this inventory separately for human and for mouse based on (i) improved gene transcript models, (ii) updated literature curation, including results from proteomic analyses of mitochondrial sub-compartments, (iii) improved homology mapping and (iv) updated versions of all seven original data sets. The updated human {MitoCarta2}.0 consists of 1158 human genes, including 918 genes in the original inventory as well as 240 additional genes. The updated mouse {MitoCarta2}.0 consists of 1158 genes, including 967 genes in the original inventory plus 191 additional genes. The improved {MitoCarta} 2.0 inventory provides a molecular framework for system-level analysis of mammalian mitochondria. \copyright The Author(s) 2015.

abstract = {N6-methyladenosine ({m6A}) modification is deemed to be co-transcriptionally installed on pre-{mRNAs}, thereby influencing various downstream {RNA} metabolism events. However, the causal relationship between {m6A} modification and {RNA} processing is often unclear, resulting in premature or even misleading generalizations on the function of {m6A} modification. Here, we develop {4sU}-coupled {m6A}-level and isoform-characterization sequencing ({4sU}-{m6A}-{LAIC}-seq) and {4sU}-{GLORI} to quantify the {m6A} levels for both newly synthesized and steady-state {RNAs} at transcript and single-base-resolution levels, respectively, which enable dissecting the relationship between {m6A} modification and alternative {RNA} polyadenylation. Unexpectedly, our results show that many {m6A} addition events occur post-transcriptionally, especially on transcripts with high {m6A} levels. Importantly, we find higher {m6A} levels on shorter 3' {UTR} isoforms, which likely result from sequential polyadenylation of longer 3' {UTR} isoforms with prolonged nuclear dwelling time. Therefore, {m6A} modification can also take place post-transcriptionally to intimately couple with other key {RNA} metabolism processes to establish and dynamically regulate epi-transcriptomics in mammalian cells.
